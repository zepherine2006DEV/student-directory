# student-directory #

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.
It is an training exercise, completed during the pre-course of Makers Academy.

## How to use ##

* Ensure you have ruby installed.
* Run the script directly from the command line.

```shell
ruby directory.rb <filename>
```
The optional <filename> argument tells the script to read students from that file.


## File Manifest ##

* **directory.rb** - main version of the student directory code.
* **directory-ex8.rb** - version of the student directory code including changes relating to the challenges set in "Step 8: Exercises".
* **typos.rb** - version of the student directory code based on the "typos" challenge. All typos corrected.
* **printmycode.rb** - simple program which reads its own file and prints its code to STDOUT.

(git config and repo files are also included)
